Research Overview:
I began my research journey the summer before my first year of college as part of the Stem Scholars program at Bucknell University where I was introduced to Joshua Stough who later introduced me to the lead of my recent research work, Eric Faden. Ever since my first summer delving into research, I've continued to seek out new opportunities to explore and understand our vastly complex world.

### Current and Previous Projects:
#### [KALMUS Color Toolkit](https://kamifirumu.scholar.bucknell.edu/):
Currently, I'm working with Professer Faden on a project he started with former student, and current PhD student at Harvard, Yida Chen. The goal of the project is to create "barcodes" from movies and films representative of the colors in them. Previously, we had a system to create barcodes from mathematical averages, but now I am working to create a system that will create barcodes more representative of what people actually see and remember from the films.

#### [The Japanese Paper Film Project](https://kamifirumu.scholar.bucknell.edu/):
For my first research project, I was working with Eric Faden, a film professor, to develop software that could be used to help preserve Japanese Paper Films from the 1930s. My work mainly consisted of using various image and video processing libraries, primarily OpenCV, to identify individual frames from our recordings and combining these into a single video that is later touched up video editors. As part of this project, I've given a handful of presentations, notable ones include a screening at the [Orphan Film Symposium](https://wp.nyu.edu/orphanfilm/2024/04/01/japanese-paper-films/) and brief research discussions held at Bucknell University. I have mostly finished my work on this project, but I still occasionally present or work on it.
